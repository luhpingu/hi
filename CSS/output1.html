		<h1 style="color:green; text-align: center"> silliman song </h1>
		<p> where the white sands and the corals, kiss the dark blue southern seas <br>
		and the palm trees tall and stately, wave their branches in the breeze <br>
		stands a college we all honor, in our hearts without a peer <br>
		silliman our alma mater, ever lovely ever dear </p>
		
		<p> loyal will we be to silliman, here's a cheers boys three times three <br>
		silliman our alma mater, silliman beside the sea </p>
		
		<p> happy days of school and college, gliding swiftly like a dream <br>
		with the things of life and beauty, are more nearly what they seem <br>
		winning victries in the classroom, on the court, the track, the field <br>
		still we work for dear old silliman, her honor bright to shield</p>
		
		<p> loyal will we be to silliman, here's a cheers boys three times three <br>
		silliman our alma mater, silliman beside the sea </p>
		
		<p> when we leave the halls of silliman, roam the world o'er near and far <br>
		still the faith and truth she gave us, will remain our guiding star <br>
		O'er high place or in lowly, fortune sends us joy or pain <br>
		to our love for dear old silliman, loyal shall we'er remain </p>
		
		<p> loyal will we be to silliman, here's a cheers boys three times three <br>
		silliman our alma mater, silliman beside the sea </p>
